is supposed to provide public baselines for data sets such as [NMNIST](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist), [IBM gestures](http://www.research.ibm.com/dvsgesture/) or [NCARS](https://www.prophesee.ai/dataset-n-cars/).
The general architecture is that of [HOTS](https://www.neuromorphic-vision.com/public/publications/1/publication.pdf), however several modifications have been added.
