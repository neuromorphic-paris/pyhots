# pyhots

is supposed to provide public baselines for data sets such as [POKER-DVS](http://www2.imse-cnm.csic.es/caviar/POKERDVS.html), [NMNIST](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist) and [IBM gestures](http://www.research.ibm.com/dvsgesture/).

The general architecture is that of [HOTS](https://www.neuromorphic-vision.com/public/publications/1/publication.pdf), however several modifications have been added.
